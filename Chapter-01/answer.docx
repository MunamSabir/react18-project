What is Emmet?
Emmet is toolkit for developers. It help developer to write code in short form
then is expend to the full code.
It's an add on for text editor.
It workflow is based on HTML and CSS.

2:
Difference between a Library and Framework?

In software development refer to reusable code that developer in can incorporate into their projects.
The control over the application flow differ between two.

Libraries are collections of functions and procedures that you can call to perform specific tasks, 
frameworks provide a broader structure for your application, which you then build upon by adding 
your own code into the predetermined slots. When using a library, you are in control; with a framework, 
you surrender some level of control to adhere to its design and structure.

What is CDN? Why do we use it?

Content Delivery Network, is a system of distributed servers that deliver content, like web pages, 
images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files, to users based on their geographic location. 
The primary goal of a CDN is to improve the speed and reliability of web content delivery to users 
worldwide.

4: 
Why is React known as React?

The name "React" reflects the library's capability to "react" to changes in the application's state. 
With React, when the state of an application changes (due to user actions, network responses, or for 
any other reason), the UI updates automatically and efficiently to reflect those changes. React allows 
developers to build UI components that can "react" to dynamic data, meaning they can update and render 
efficiently in response to data changes.

5:
What is crossorigin in script tag?

The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to handle requests for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
in HTML documents. This attribute is crucial when you are loading resources, like scripts, from domains 
different than the domain serving the HTML page.

Understanding and using the crossorigin attribute is crucial when dealing with scripts hosted on different 
domains, as it allows developers to make secure and controlled cross-origin requests while maintaining access 
to detailed error information when necessary.

There are 3 values of crossorigin
Anonymous:

crossorigin="anonymous"
With this value, the browser sends the cross-origin request without credentials 
(like cookies or HTTP authentication). However, the server must include the appropriate CORS headers 
(like Access-Control-Allow-Origin) in the response, and it can use a wildcard * or the requesting domain.
If the server does not include the necessary CORS headers in the response, the request fails.

Use-Credentials:
crossorigin="use-credentials"
In this case, the browser sends the cross-origin request with credentials. Again, the server must include 
the proper CORS headers in the response, but it can't use a wildcard * for Access-Control-Allow-Origin. 
Instead, it must specify the exact domain of the requesting site.

Not Present / Omitted:
If the crossorigin attribute is not present, the request is made without CORS, meaning it's a same-origin 
request. For cross-origin requests without the crossorigin attribute, the browser won't execute the script 
and will throw an error if the response doesn't have the correct CORS headers.

What is difference between React and ReactDOM

React and ReactDOM are two libraries that work together to build React applications, 
but they have different roles and responsibilities.

React:
Core Library: React is the core library that includes the fundamental functionalities and concepts of React, 
like the virtual DOM, components, props, and state.

ReactDOM:
DOM Manipulation: ReactDOM is responsible for rendering React components into the DOM. It acts as a bridge between 
the React core library and the DOM.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

These files are built to serve different purposes and environments: development and production, respectively.

react.development.js:
Development Environment:
This file is optimized for a development environment.
It's not minified, meaning the code is readable and not compressed, facilitating debugging and development.

react.production.min.js:
Production Environment:
This file is optimized for production environments.
It's minified, meaning the code is compressed to reduce its size, resulting in faster load times. 
The minification process removes whitespace, comments, and renames variables to shorter names, making
the file size as small as possible.

Example:
<!-- Development Version -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>

<!-- Production Version -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>

8:
What is async and defer?

async and defer are attributes that you can add to the <script> tag in HTML to control how JavaScript 
files are loaded and executed in relation to the HTML document. Both attributes are used with external scripts.

async or defer based on your script’s dependencies and execution requirements. If the script is independent and 
doesn’t rely on the DOM or other scripts, async might be suitable. If the script needs a fully parsed DOM or depends 
on the execution order, defer is a better choice. If neither attribute is used, the script is fetched and executed 
synchronously, blocking the parser in the process
