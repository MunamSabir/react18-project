 What is `NPM`?
 Itâ€™s a popular package manager for the JavaScript programming language, and it's 
 particularly associated with Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime that allows for 
 the execution of JavaScript code server-side.

Package Repository: NPM provides access to a large repository of open-source packages 
(called modules) that developers have shared for the community's use.
Package Management: NPM allows developers to manage and control packages within their 
projects. Developers can specify which package versions they want to install, update 
packages easily, and handle package dependencies

This is how we install packages using command line
npm install -g <package-name>
